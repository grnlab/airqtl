# Cell state-specific single-cell eQTL mapping and cGRN inference

This is an [airqtl](https://github.com/grnlab/airqtl) tutorial to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and infer causal gene regulatory networks (cGRNs) at the cell state level of specificity. The Randolph et al [dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4273999) from their [original study](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abg0928) is used.

To use this tutorial, first [install airqtl](https://github.com/grnlab/airqtl#installation) and download this folder. You may need to update `Snakefile.config`, especially the `device` parameter if you prefer to use a CPU or a different GPU. Then the pipeline can be run with `snakemake -j 1` in shell environment. It takes ~1 day on a top-end Dell Alienware Aurora R16Â®, in which single-cell eQTL mapping takes ~10mins for each cell state.

More documentation is underway to help you understand and customize this pipeline and repurpose it for your own data.
